# dog_breed_classifier
As a part of this hands on project for the Udacity deep learning nanodegree course, I created a CNN (Convolutional neural network) from scratch. This algorithm does the following:
1. identifies a dog picture with it's breed
2. identifies a human face and predicts the closest dog breed
3. displays an error when the image is neither dog or human
